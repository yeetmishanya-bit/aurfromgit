aurfromgit.
This program is made on rust by me while i am currently learning it.
Use this program only when AUR is down, it exeutes command to clone AUR package exactly from git to your /home directory
Any positive reviews appreciated ;)

Requires:
 * Git package installed

**HOW TO USE:**
  1.Open a terminal in executable's directory(very important)
  2.Execute the binary via ./main
  3.Enter desired package name
  4.Wait until package cloning is done
  5.Close the binary
